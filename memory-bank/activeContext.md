# Active Context - Rota Robin

## Current Focus

Backend implementation ready to begin - MVP scope simplified to focus on core timekeeping and time-off management.

## Recent Accomplishments

- ✅ Docker DevContainer configuration completed
- ✅ UV package management integrated
- ✅ SSH directory mounted for git operations
- ✅ Memory Bank structure established
- ✅ Project documentation organized
- ✅ MVP scope refactored to remove rota/scheduling complexity

## Current State

- **Development Environment**: Fully configured and ready
- **Frontend**: React application structure in place with all core pages
- **Backend**: Django backend needs implementation
- **Database**: PostgreSQL service configured
- **Documentation**: PRD updated with simplified MVP scope, Memory Bank active

## Next Priorities
