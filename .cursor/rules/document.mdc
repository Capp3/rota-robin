Document/Markdown files should never by in the root direcory!

Root directory has; tasks.md, fineopinions_diagram.md, and fineopinion_node_settings.md ONLY! All other docs are in other folders.

If a doc is useful for user or developer, but it in docs. If the document is notes, creative, desicion documentation, put it in the memory-bank folder.

Keep root clean
